# gothenburg-events

You can explore Gothenburg events and optionally filter them by dates and/or search word. You have to install dependencies (npm install) separately for the server and the client sides and have both of them running (npm start) simultaneously.

You need to request authorization to use the API and configurate your .env. Information about the API can be found here: https://catalog.goteborg.se/catalog/6/datasets/10
